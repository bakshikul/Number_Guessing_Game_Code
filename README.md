<h1>🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)</h1>
<header>
<p>This repository contains a simple Number Guessing Game written in Python.
It is my first GitHub repository, created to practice basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input, and the random module.</p>
<h3>How the Game Works</h3>
<p>The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
The user is prompted to guess the number.
The program provides feedback:
Too high
Too low
The user can make unlimited attempts until the correct number is guessed.
Once guessed correctly, the game ends</p>
